Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom/n
But I think it's 'cause of me/n 
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house/n
It's like I couldn't breathe/n
You heard the rumors from Inez/n
You can't believe a word she says/n
Most times, but this time it was true/n
The worst thing that I ever did/n
Was what I did to you/n

But if I just showed up at your party/n
Would you have me?/n
Would you want me?/n
Would you tell me to go fuck myself/n
Or lead me to the garden?/n
In the garden would you trust me/n
If I told you it was just a summer thing?/n
I'm only seventeen/n
I don't know anything but I know I miss you/n

Betty, I know where it all went wrong/n
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym/n
I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that/n
Plus, I saw you dance with him/n
You heard the rumors from Inez/n
You can't believe a word she says/n
Most times, but this time it was true/n
The worst thing that I ever did/n
Was what I did to you/n

But if I just showed up at your party/n
Would you have me?/n
Would you want me?/n
Would you tell me to go fuck myself/n
Or lead me to the garden?/n
In the garden would you trust me/n
If I told you it was just a summer thing?/n
I'm only seventeen/n
I don't know anything but I know I miss you/n

I was walking home on broken cobblestones/n
Just thinking of you when she pulled up/n
Like a figment of my worst intentions/n
She said "James, get in, let's drive"/n
Those days turned into nights/n
Slept next to her but/n
I dreamt of you all summer long/n

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep/n
And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in/n
Betty, right now is the last time/n
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again/n
The only thing I wanna do/n
Is make it up to you/n

So, I showed up at your party/n
Yeah, I showed up at your party/n
Yeah, I showed up at your party/n
Will you have me?/n
Will you love me?/n
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?/n
If you kiss me/n
Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?/n
I'm only seventeen/n
I don't know anything/n
But I know I miss you/n
Standing in your cardigan/n
Kissing in my car again/n
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you/n
